# Reportify
## Theme Chosen
-  AI for social good
    - Reason we chose this_
    - helps people of our city
    - keeps our city clean
    - solves the problems of our city

## Our Idea- reportify
- Report local issues: users can easily report public problems happening around them such as (potholes, broken streetlights, water leakage, etc.)
- Image and location support: 
    - Each report can include:
        - A photo of the issue
        - A short description
        - The location (text-based or map-based depending on future upgrades)
    
- Community voting system: 
    - Inspired by redit style ranking:
        - Upvote: genuine and important issues.
        - Downvote: irrelavent and spam issues.
    - All issues with high upvotes get prioritized for review


## How it helps us and society
- Many existing government portals struggle with usability and reliability, so we set out to build a more efficient platform enhanced with AI (Gemini).
- Users can submit issues from their locality—such as road damage, poor infrastructure, malfunctioning streetlights, and more.
- The integrated AI system organizes these submissions and generates a clear, well-structured report.
-  This report can then be forwarded to local officials or the Resident Welfare Association (RWA) for review.
-  From there, the RWA or concerned authorities can formally submit the compiled report to the government.
