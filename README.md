# Reportify
## Theme Chosen
 AI for social good
- Reason we chose this_
- helps people of our city
- keeps our city clean
- solves the problems of our city
## Our Idea- reportify
- repot local issues: users can easily report public problems happening around them such as (potholes, broken streetlights, water leakage, etc.)
- image and location support: 
    - each report can include:
        - a photo of the issue
        - a short description
        - the location (text-based or map-based depending on future upgrades)
    
- community voting system: 
    - inspired by redit style ranking:
        - upvote: genuine and important issues.
        - downvote: irrelavent and spam issues.
    - all issues with high upvotes get prioritized for review


## How it helps us and society


- Many existing government portals struggle with usability and reliability, so we set out to build a more efficient platform enhanced with AI (Gemini).
- Users can submit issues from their locality—such as road damage, poor infrastructure, malfunctioning streetlights, and more.
- The integrated AI system organizes these submissions and generates a clear, well-structured report.
-  This report can then be forwarded to local officials or the Resident Welfare Association (RWA) for review.
-  From there, the RWA or concerned authorities can formally submit the compiled report to the government.
